== Overview

This section describes the Bolt Protocol, version 1.

The Bolt Protocol is a client-server protocol where messages are exchanged between a client who drives an interaction and a server that processes and responds to client requests.
Every exchange of messages is initiated by the client with one or more request messages; in turn these requests are consumed by the server and corresponding response messages are returned.

The diagram below illustrates a typical interaction including the order of messages sent and the life spans of the session and job (which are described in more detail in other chapters).

Starting with version 1, each release of Bolt is assigned a unique, integral version number.
This number and the associated specification refers to every aspect of the protocol except for the handshake, which is unversioned.
Driver authors should note that subsequent protocol versions are likely to be incompatible and with the exception of the handshake, there is no guarantee that any transport or serialisation code can be shared across versions.

The protocol is divided into two layers -- <<transport>> and <<messaging>>.
